## Third-Party Software and Installation Steps
-No third-party-software required

## Training the Model
- no model to train, just steps to follow.

## Making Predictions on a New Test Set
- no predictions as there is no model, our metric is a grade based on historical plays.

## Important Side Effects
- When using our code, make sure to follow the path information correctly, all data used was provided by the NFL, there was nothing external used. 

## Key Assumptions/ Important Information
- - When running the code per game, it's important to wait for the steps to complete, especially when running the overlap function. Note - if running the overlap function for more than one game, the code can be manually stopped once the text 'all frames completed' comes.
- - If paths are correct, code should run seamlessly (when game and week are properly specified.
